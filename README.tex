The database included with this assignment is a simplified 
example accounts payable database consisting of three tables;
an account table, account_id (int), balance (signed double), last_payment_date (DATE);
a payments table, payment_id (int), account_id (int), amount (double), amount_sign (bool), date_made (date);
and a people table, account_id (int), first_name (varchar(20)), last_name (varchar(20)), phone_number (varchar(12));

Supported Datbase Functions:
	The database supports displaying any of the three tables
	Searching any three of the tables by ID number
	Updating a record by ID number
	Creating new entrys in any of the three tables
	And deleting an entry from any of the tables
	
	Some notes include that the program automatically creates pythondb.db
	if it is not detected on startup, this file is created in the PWD
	the user does not have any control over this function as I realized
	that given the programs function there is not reason for the user to
	be able to do this
	
	Additionally the DB program does not have much input sanatization 
	and is not secure in the slightest and should not be used as such
	
	amount_sign is used in the payments table with 1 representing a
	positive value and 0  a negative value
	
	the strings.py is included with DB.py, this file holds the intial SQL
	strings that intialize the database in addition to vital header info
	A better design might have the database wright the header values
	to this file on database creation to avoid hard-coded variables and
	allow for future expansion
